## Android App to Save your passwords and we don't keep any passwords with us!
- No password or username is saved in the raw form, all of them are encrypted and then saved in Firebase.
- We ask you to make a key that'll unlock all your passwords, you can't change it and we can never know it, we only save it's MD5 hash value to validate if you enter the right key.

### -It's more secure than you'd think of it.
